Splitwise MVP:

1. Users can register amd update their profiles
  -- DONE

2. A user's profile should contain at least their name, phone number and password
  -- DONE
    --- Using user's email instead of phone number

3. Users can participate in expenses with other users
  -- DONE

4. Users can participate in groups
  -- DONE

5. To add an expense, a user must specify either the group or the other users involved in
the expense, along with who paid what and who owes what. They must also specify a description
of the expense.
  -- DONE

6. A user can see their total owed amount

7. A user can see a history of the expenses they are involved in
  -- DONE

8. A user can see a history of the expenses made in a group that they are participating in
  -- DONE

9. Users should not be able to query about groups they are not a member of
  -- DONE

10. Only the user who has created a group can add/remove members to the group
  -- DONE

11. Users can request a settlement. The applicant should show a list of transactions, which when
executed will ensure that the user no longer owes or receives money from any other user.
Note that this need not settle-up any other users.

12. Users can request a settle-up for any group they are participating in.
The application should show a list of transactions, which if executed, will ensure that
everyone participating in the group is settled up (owes a net of â‚¹0).
Note that this will only deal with the expenses made inside that group. Expenses outside this
group need not be settled.
  -- DONE

13. Good to have requirements.
When settling a group, we should try to minimize the number of transactions that the group
members should make to settle up.
  -- PARTIALLY COMPLETED
    --- "Greedy Settlement Algo" for group settlement
